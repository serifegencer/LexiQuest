# LEXİQUEST

## purpose of the project
It is both a memory game to keep the mind alive and a matching game that teaches English words related to various categories.In this way, we can increase our English vocabulary. 

## project usage
In the main menu, you select the area you want to learn about from the categories. For each selected area, a matching game is played where the cards are turned over. You can click on the cards to see the words. If the words do not match, the cards are flipped back over, so you need to remember the positions of the words. To complete the level, you need to match the words correctly. For each correct match, your score increases by 10 points, and the number of incorrect moves is counted. As you level up, the number of cards increases, making the game more challenging. The player can either return to the main menu or restart the level at any time. Once the maximum level is reached, you can compete in different categories from the main menu.
